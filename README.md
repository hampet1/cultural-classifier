<h1 align="center"> Cultural classifier </h1>

Cultural classifier is an application using ML model to distinguish between two archaeological cultures (specifically epigravettian and epiaurignacian) that are hard to classify with the conventional classification approach that relies on analysing the stone tool industry.<br>

* machine learning for classification purposes in archaeology
* practical usage of xgboost model as a complement for classifying stone industry
